# Hyperwine

Hyperwine is a single-binary packaging of Wine for Flatpak applications. Originally designed for the 
[InVision Studio Flatpak](https://github.com/sr229/com.invisionapp.Studio), Hyperwine can also be reused
as a minimal Wine installation.

## What comes in the box?

- WoW64
- Winetricks
- Lutris patches (basically Proton and Lutris's own patches to work in games).

By default, we remove the HAL, LDAP, 16-bit Windows and stuff you don't need.
